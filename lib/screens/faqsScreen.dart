    'The data from uploaded tracks is analysed, and the factors related to the physical coordinates are utilised to determine CO2 hotspots and traffic flow. The control of traffic flow can also be done using the interpretation of the results from this data.',
    'Informed consent for location data refers to telling the user about what location data is being used or processed by the offered service and always asking for permission to use the location data without compromising the user\'s privacy.',
    'Sharing personal location information (PLI) is crucial since a user\'s position coordinates might disclose a lot about them. This data, after analyzing and making inferences, can be utilized to learn about the user\'s routinely visited destinations, thereby jeopardizing their privacy.',
